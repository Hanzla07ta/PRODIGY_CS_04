Here's a simplified version of how this basic keylogger program will work:

1. **Capture Keystrokes**: The program continuously listens for keyboard events, capturing each keystroke.
2. **Logging**: Each keystroke is logged to a file.
3. **Silent Operation**: The keylogger operates silently in the background, without any user interaction.
4. **File Saving**: The logged keystrokes are saved to a specified file location.
5. **Termination**: The program can be terminated manually to stop logging keystrokes.

With these simple steps, this keylogger program will effectively capture and log keystrokes on the system.
